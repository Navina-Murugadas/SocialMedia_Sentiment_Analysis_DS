# SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Social media sentiment analysis is the process of retrieving information about a consumer’s perception of a product, service or brand.  Basically, social sentiment analysis involves tracking brand mentions and analyzing the collected text data. This offers businesses valuable insights into their audience’s opinions, behaviors, and feelings.  In general, AI-powered analytics haven’t been able to identify complex individual emotions, such as fear or enthusiasm. So far, brand mentions falling under three categories based on their overall sentiment: Positive, Negative and Neutral.  Sentiment analysis is used in social media monitoring, allowing businesses to gain insights about how customers feel about certain topics, and detect urgent issues in real time before they spiral out of control.
